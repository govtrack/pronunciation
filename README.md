Prononciation Guide for the Names of Members of Congress
========================================================

This project contains a pronunciation guide for the names of current and recent-past Members of the United States Congress. This is a project of GovTrack.us. The first 539 records were created by Ezra Wyschogrod.

[legislators.yaml](legislators.yaml) is a YAML-formatted file. Each record is a current or recent-past Member of Congress which looks like:

```yaml
- id:
    govtrack: 400623
  name: Debbie // Wasserman Schultz
  ipa: dɛbi // wasɹ̩mən ʃʊlt͡s
  respell: DE-bee // WAS-er-mun shuults
  notes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVmGudgxiRg
```

The record has four parts:

`id`...`govtrack` provides the numeric ID of the Member of Congress on GovTrack.

`name` provides the first and last name of the Member of Congress, as used by this project, separated by `//`.

`ipa` provides the pronunciation of the name using the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) the world-wide standard for transcribing the sounds of speech. An IPA transcription is provided for the name as it appears in the `name` field, with the corresponding name parts separated by `//`.

`respell` provides a friendly guide to the pronunciation of the name using a "[respelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_respelling_for_English)". The respelling is provided for the name as it appears in the `name` field, with the corresponding name parts separated by `//`. We use a respelling guide similar to the [Pocket Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Oxford-English-Dictionary-Dictionaries/dp/0199666156/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1508765253&sr=8-5&keywords=pocket+oxford):

In addition, capitalization is used to indicate primary stress, syllables are separated by dashes, and multi-word names, whether separated by dashes or spaces, are broken out by spaces.
